# Regex-Formatter
Regex Formatter is a web tool that converts pasted lists (CSV, comma‑separated, newline, or spreadsheet data) into ready‑to‑use regular expressions with optional flags and formatting options. It supports selecting a specific input column, auto-detecting or choosing delimiters, adding anchors and word boundaries, and applying transforms such as deduplication, sorting, and whitespace normalization before generating a final regex pattern and flags.
